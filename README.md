# JavaScript-A-Dynamic-Shopping-List
This is the repository for a JavaScript Program using DOM that allows you to add item and delete it. 

In this project, I've created an intuitive solution where you can dynamically add items to your shopping list with ease. Say goodbye to the hassle of managing your grocery list on paper, and hello to the convenience of digital organization! With this simple interface, you  simply input the item you need, hit the 'Add' button, and watch as it seamlessly integrates into your list. Each added item comes with its own delete button, allowing you to effortlessly remove any unwanted entries. I've also optimized the user experience by ensuring the input field is automatically emptied and ready for your next item. No more unnecessary clicks or typing!

It's a part of my learning for JavaScript DOM manipulation. Happy Learning and Happy shopping!
